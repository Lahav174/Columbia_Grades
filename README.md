# EZACU
### The database of A-Ranges at Columbia University
This website allows users to search and see how often a professor gave A-, A or A+ grades (A-Range) in each of the classes they taught. Users can also use a filter to display all of the classes that will satisfy certain basic credit requirements. Results are always sorted by A-Range.

The website can be found at www.ezacu.com.

Ezacu is **not** endorsed by the Columbia administration, and was built by a Columbia student.
